Social Media application made with modern technologies. This is repository for my diploma project. Goal is to create an App in Microservice architecture.
Frontend is made with Angular 17 and Angular Material. Backend is made with Spring Boot 3. UI is full responsive and PWA ready.


## How this app looks like
